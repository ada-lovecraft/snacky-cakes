It’s very fast-paced and can feel pretty random for it at times, but I love it.

There are two teams, the Red Team and the Blue Team. The Blue Team has a President. The Red Team has a Bomber. Players are equally distributed between two rooms (separate playing areas). The game consists of 5 timed rounds. At the end of each round, some players will be traded into opposing rooms. If the Red Team’s Bomber is in the same room as the President at the end of the game, then the Red Team wins. Otherwise the Blue Team wins.</p></div><div class="step"><h2 class="highlight">Step 1: Setup the deck.</h2><p>The character deck includes the Bomber card, the Blue President card, and an equal number of Red and Blue Team cards. There will be one character card in the game for each player in the game.</p></div><div class="step"><h2 class="highlight">Step 2: Randomly Give Out the Character Cards</h2><p>Each player receives one character card face down. The character cards are secret but can be revealed during the game. Players should not discuss their character cards with one another until the game begins.</p></div><div class="step"><img src="http://tworoomsandaboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tworoomcards_myproduct1.png" class="pull-left"><h2 class="highlight">Step 3: Two Rooms...</h2><p>Randomly separate the players into two rooms as evenly as you can. The “rooms” can be separated by a wall, door, or simply two open areas at a distance from each other. It is not important if players can see one another, but separate rooms shouldn’t be able to hear one another.</p></div><div class="step"><h2 class="highlight">Step 4: Start The Timer</h2><p>At the end of each round, the room leader selects a number of hostages to change rooms. The game concludes at the end of the 1 minute round after the last hostage exchange.</p></div><div class="step"><h2 class="highlight">Step 5: ... and a Boom!</h2><p>At the end of the last hostage exchange, everyone reveals their character cards. Whichever room has the Bomber in it will explode, killing everyone inside. If the President is in the room with Bomber, then the entire Red Team wins, if not, The President is safe and the entire Blue Team wins.</p></div></div></div><a name="downloads"></a><div class="marketing downloads dark-gradient"><div class="container"><h1>Download</h1><h2 class="text-left highlight">What are you waiting for?</h2><div class="row"><div class="span6"><div class="text-left">Two Rooms and a Boom isn’t available in stores yet, though we hope to be Kickstarting it by Origins 2013.
